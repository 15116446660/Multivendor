# Multi Vendor 

Multi Vendor is a simple stand alone Open source script that can be used for ecommerce purposes.
## Features
Multi Vendor is built on top of OpenCart 3.x thus it inherits all the inbuilt  features of OpenCart.
You can easily use the Multi Vendor to create a Marketplace store where both admin and customers can sell their goods and services.
The admin will earn money through Membership plans and commissions on sales
## Installation
    Unzip the zip files to your web directory.
    Rename the admin/config-dist.php,seller/config-dist.php and config-dist.php files to config.php.
    Make sure the seller/config.php, admin/config.php, config.php files have read and write permissions.
    Visit http://yourdomain.com/install to start the installtion process
    
    
## To do
Fix code intentions and adapt standard OpenCart coding styles.
## Extensions
Multi Vendor extensions can be created using the same pattern like OpenCart extensions.
VQMODS will work though you have to check if they really fit with the Multi Vendor script.
